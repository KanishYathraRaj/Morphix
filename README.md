# Morphix

Morphix is a Chrome extension that allows users to modify website UI elements using Large Language Models (LLMs).  
It interprets user instructions and applies UI changes dynamically on webpages.

## ✨ Features

- Modify website UI elements using natural language instructions  
- Apply changes such as text updates, style adjustments, and layout tweaks  
- Works as a Chrome extension with client-side script injection  
- Lightweight and easy to use

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User provides a UI-related instruction (e.g., change button color, update text).
2. The instruction is sent to an LLM API.
3. The LLM returns a structured response describing the UI changes.
4. Morphix applies these changes to the webpage using JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
